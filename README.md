1) Subsystem Including a signal Generator for testing The Sensor Model in with different Cases than can be used in MIL,SIL test: Contains a fixed slope ramp signal (Models External Force exerted on Pedal ) added to two different ramp signals to create two different signals for each sensor to detect any errors that occur to one of them or both
2) Subsystem for the function of each Sensor: The sensor function is a linear function with an added offset
3) Logical Operators Subsystem to detect errors and decide the source of the error
4) A C coded subsystem equivalent to Fault Detector subsystem for SIL test
